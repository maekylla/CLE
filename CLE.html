<h3><strong>G.R.A.S.P.S OF THE PERFORMANCE TASK</strong></h3>
<p>You are one of the officers of your Parish/Church Youth Council. After your weekly council meeting, the concerns of the Christian family were discussed. Abortion, depression, substance abuse, suicide, prostitution, online game addiction, teenage pregnancy, and domestic violence, among others, greatly affect the Christian family today.</p>
<p>The council president asked for suggestions as to how the local Parish, through the Youth Council, can help address these issues through the making of an advocacy project. Project proposals would have to be sent a week from now, and the council will choose two projects to implement in the following semester.</p>
<p>You and your group are interested and willing to submit an advocacy proposal. Not only that you believe that it is of utmost importance to continue holding on to one&rsquo;s faith and Christian values of a family, you also see this as an invitation from God to spread awareness and help those people who are lost not to go astray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Guidelines:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. The title page includes the name of the advocacy project, the members of the group, along with the subject, grade level, section, and name of the teacher.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. The advocacy project proposal includes an introduction of the members of the group. It may include a brief background about them, and their contribution and/or insights about the performance task.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. The introduction (<em>this is your Scaffold 3 Activity</em>) of the chosen issue is stated clearly. It includes the background of the issue, its root causes, and the stand of the Church.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. The rationale of the project is included in the advocacy project proposal. It explains the significance of the project and the need it aims to address in a minimum of 8 sentences.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. The advocacy project provides a minimum of five (5) solutions to the chosen issues with provided pictures or images. (<em>solutions must be well-researched and sources must be honored</em>)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. The project proposal outlines at least three objectives and specifies its beneficiaries.</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. The project proposal ends with a prayer and acknowledgments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. The project proposal is creative, appropriate, and engaging. It does not contain any foul language.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9. You can utilize MSWord, MS PowerPoint, PDF, and HTML.</strong></p>
